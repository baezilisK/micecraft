Open source Minecraft clone in C.

Rationale:
  * An open-source Minecraft would have provided a wealth of interesting
    code to study, and this project attempts to bridge that gap. Yes,
    the code to Infiniminer was eventually released, but Notch took it
    so much farther as to make the original redundant. Plus, it was
    written in C#.
  * Recently I've started to dislike the role-playing direction
    Minecraft is heading. Early versions were fantastic (I loved the
    early beta; the alpha looked amazing) but in my view not much has
    improved since then. So this is an attempt to further investage its
    potential in regard to building and world exploration.
